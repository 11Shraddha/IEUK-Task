# JOURNEY TO NET ZERO IN AGRICULTURE SECTOR

**Barriers to net zero action for farmers**

1. *Lack of Data:* Agriculture SMEs often lake the necessary data to track their emissions accurately so they are unable to take meaningful actions towards net-zero targets. Many SMEs don’t own the building so it is not always possible to install meters to measure energy usage. Due to this few SMEs don’t know how their business is related to sustainability and journey to Net Zero.
   
2. *Fear of low returns:* Almost 40% of SMEs are hesitant to invest in sustainability measures due to concerns about the costs involved and low returns on investments. Notably, 11% of UK smaller businesses have already accessed external finance to support net-zero actions.

3. *Out-of-control supply chain:* Farmers heavily rely on external suppliers for inputs like fertilizers, seeds and equipment, which may have associated emissions in their production and supply chain.

So I have come up with a solution to design an app which includes:
- Calculate the emission and display the progress towards the journey to net zero. 
- Display the hotspot for emission by Data Analysis & visualization 
- Support for decision-making and Networking for success stories
- Display the indirect contribution they can do while purchasing machinery from manufactures
